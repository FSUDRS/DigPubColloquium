**February 15th, Noon - 5pm**

The Florida State University Libraries' Office of Digital Research and Scholarship is pleased to host a half-day colloquium on Thursday, February 15th from Noon to 5pm. This colloquium will foster conversation among attendees centering around the growth of digital publication formats in the academic landscape, and the impact these new publication avenues have on scholarly production. 

A panel of FSU faculty members from diverse disciplines and with a variety of digital publishing experience will drive discussion, engaging with audience members to situate what researchers across campus have experienced as challenges in this developing field, as well as what they see as avenues for future growth. 

The FSU Libraries are excited to welcome Dr. Cheryl E. Ball as invited special guest panelist at this event.

Dr. Ball is Associate Professor of Digital Publishing Studies, Director of the Digital Publishing Institute at West Virginia University, and editor of Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy.
